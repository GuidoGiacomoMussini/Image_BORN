# Image_BORN

[BORN Algorithm](https://bornrule.eguidotti.com/) applied to Images

The datasets used are: 

* [ISIC10000](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nodoubttome/skin-cancer9-classesisic) (multiclass and binary classificiation, where binary is benign vs malignant tumor)
* [Brain Cancer](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri)

In order to create the .h5 input files you have to run the script 'build_datasets' with your own kaggle credentials.
